Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). 
It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach. Its testing capabilities can 
be extended by test libraries implemented either with Python or Java, and users can create new higher-level keywords from existing
ones using the same syntax that is used for creating test cases.
Robot Framework is operating system and application independent. The core framework is implemented using Python and runs also on 
Jython (JVM) and Iron Python (.NET).
